The RAMB36E1 RISCV_demonstrator_i/riscv_wrapper_0/inst/rv_tcm_top/u_tcm/secure_zone.no_enc_updater.u_enc_ram/ram_reg_0_0 has an input control pin RISCV_demonstrator_i/riscv_wrapper_0/inst/rv_tcm_top/u_tcm/secure_zone.no_enc_updater.u_enc_ram/ram_reg_0_0/WEA[0] (net: RISCV_demonstrator_i/riscv_wrapper_0/inst/rv_tcm_top/u_tcm/secure_zone.no_enc_updater.u_enc_ram/WEA[0]) which is driven by a register (RISCV_demonstrator_i/riscv_wrapper_0/inst/rv_tcm_top/u_core/u_lsu/mem_addr_q_reg[16]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
